# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import the math library to solve using distance formula
### Step 2: 
enter the given matrices
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](formula.jpg)
### Step 4:

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
dist=math.sqrt (((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(dist))
```  

### OUTPUT:
